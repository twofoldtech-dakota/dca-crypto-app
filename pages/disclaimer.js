            Policy of Plaid. SCOPE We at Plaid Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “us” or
            “our”) know you care about how your personal information is used and
            shared – and we take your privacy seriously. This privacy policy
            (“Privacy Policy”) covers our treatment of personally identifiable
            information (“Personal Information”), and certain non-personally
            identifiable information, that we gather when you use or otherwise
            engage (via mobile application, web browsing or otherwise) with our
            website or services (collectively, the “Service”). It describes what
            types of information we collect, how we use that information, and
            who we share that information with. By using or accessing the
            Service in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept and agree to
            the terms, practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy,
            and you hereby consent that we may collect, use, and share your
            information as set forth below. This policy does not apply to any
            website, product or service of any third-party company even if the
            website or application links to (or from) the Service. Plaid does
            not operate those websites, products, or services – please always
            review the privacy practices of a company before deciding whether to
            provide any information to them. INFORMATION WE COLLECT In general,
            we collect information in a number of ways, including (i) when a
            client or end-user provides it directly to us via the Website and/or
            Service, (ii) when we obtain end-user information through trusted
            third parties including financial institutions, (iii) through your
            continued access of the Service, including data passively collected
            through technology such as “cookies”. The types of information we
            collect and our use of that information will depend on whether you
            are a Website Visitor, Client, or End-User. By signing up for the
            Service, whether directly on our site, with one of the third-party
            applications that uses our software, or by any other means, you
            consent to these terms. Some features of the Service allow you to
            provide content, including financial credentials and information, to
            the Service. All content submitted by you to the Service or
            collected on your behalf from a third-party (e.g., client)
            application or a financial institution (e.g., a bank) may be
            retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account.
            We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a
            manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as described in
            this Privacy Policy. COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES We automatically
            receive and record information from your web browser when you
            interact with the Service, including your IP address and cookie
            information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and
            also to facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction
            with the Service (e.g., what links you have clicked on). Generally,
            the Service automatically collects usage information, such as the
            number and frequency of visitors to the Site. We may use this data
            in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a
            manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate
            data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how
            often individuals use parts of the Service so that we can analyze
            and improve them. We may also receive a confirmation when you open
            an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer
            service. Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your
            computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your

            cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of
            the Service and may associate that information with your Account if
            you have one. Most browsers have an option for turning off the
            cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
            cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser
            software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in
            a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies
            active, because they enable you to take advantage of the most
            attractive features of the Service. This Privacy Policy covers our
            use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third
            parties. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies
            on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link
            points may set cookies on your computer. WEBSITE VISITORS To simply

            uses your Personal Information as follows: To operate and maintain

            referenced in the “Sharing and Disclosure” section below (such as,
            for the purposes of legal compliance). SHARING AND DISCLOSURE Plaid
            does not sell or rent any personal information to marketers or third
            parties that have not been explicitly authorized (e.g., in the case
            of a client). We may share your Personal Information with trusted
            third parties who are integral to the operation of our Website and
            the Service, including but not limited to financial institutions,
            payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as
            well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to
            receive your Personal Information. We may store your Personal
            Information in locations outside the direct control of Plaid, for
            instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers.
            If you authorize an application to access your Plaid account, you
            acknowledge that we may share financial information with the third
            party that provides the authorized application. The use of your
            information by such third party will be subject to their applicable
            privacy policy, which you should carefully review. We may disclose
            your Personal Information to law enforcement, government officials,
            or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by
            subpoena, court order or other legal process, (ii) we must do so to
            comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations, including credit
            card rules, (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is
            necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report
            suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our
            Terms of Use. We will only disclose your Personal Information in
            response to such a request if we believe in good faith that doing so
            is necessary to comply with applicable law or a legal obligation to
            which we are bound. If we receive such a request, we will use
            reasonable efforts to give you prompt notice, so that you may
            contest it if you choose. We will not provide you such notice if we
            determine in good faith that either (a) we are not permitted to
            provide it under applicable law, or (b) that doing so would result
            in an imminent risk of death, serious physical injury or significant
            property loss or damage to Plaid or a third party. In addition, in
            the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or
            other similar events, certain information in our possession may be
            transferred to our successor or assign. We may occasionally email
            you with information about offers or new services. You can opt out
            of these email communications by replying with unsubscribe in the
            subject line, or via an unsubscribe link included in such
            communications. However, you will continue to receive certain email
            communications related to your account including information
            regarding transactions and your relationship with Plaid. PROTECTION
            OF INFORMATION Although no data storage or transmission can be 100%
            secure, we take significant steps to protect user and account
            information to ensure that it is kept private. Plaid maintains
            strict administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect
            information stored in our servers, which are located in the United
            States. Access to information is limited (through user and password
            credentials and software systems) to those employees who require it
            to perform their job functions. We use industry- standard Secure
            Socket Layer encryption to safeguard the account registration and
            sign-up information, along with the end-user sign-up process. Other
            safeguards include, but are not limited to data encryption,
            firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.
            UPDATES This Privacy Policy was last changed on the date set forth
            at the top of the policy. We’re constantly trying to improve the
            Service, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to
            time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice
            on our website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.
            In addition, we will also edit the date at the top of this policy to
            reflect the date of the changes. Please note that if you’ve opted
            not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided
            us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern
            your use of the Service, and you are still responsible for reading
            and understanding them. If you use the Service after any changes to
            the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of
            the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the
            Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.
            INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN We do not knowingly collect or solicit

            will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe
            that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information,
